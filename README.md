In this project I develop a dynamic and interactive dashboard in Power BI of a fictitious company who sales cars across USA. 

Acknowledgement: The dataset used here is taken from Kaggle. And the project is a recreation of a content of YouTube Channel 'Data Tutorial'.

Here based on problem statement I develop some key matrics and useful visualizations to fullfill the requirements of stakeholders.

**Some features used in developing the dashboard**
- Time intelligent function like CALENDAR
- Advance DAX functions like TOTALYTD, CALCULATE, TOTALMTD, CONCATENATE, IF, MAXX, ALLSELECTED etc.

**Some visuals used in developing the dashboard**
- Card
- Area Chart
- Donut Chart
- Map
- Table
- Slicer
- Page Navigator Buttons
- Data Bars under Conditional formatting
